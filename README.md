# NodeJS-Project-Demo
## Description
This project is designed to streamline the management of employee details for the HR team of a corporate organization. It provides a solution for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee information, ensuring efficient tracking and management of employee data. By using this tool, HR personnel can handle employee records in a structured and dynamic manner.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js (Version 20)
- **Database**: XYZ (considering alternatives such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular (considering options such as React, Vue.js with justifications for each)
- **Repository**: GitHub
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest, Mocha
- **Security Tools**: Helmet, JWT, bcrypt

## Functionalities
- **Create Employee Records**: Add new fields to existing tables to capture details of new employees.
- **Read Employee Records**: View existing employee details from the database.
- **Update Employee Records**: Modify existing employee information as needed.
- **Delete Employee Records**: Remove employee details when they are no longer part of the organization.

## Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Using Jest and Mocha to test individual components and functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensuring that different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Using tools like Cypress to test the complete flow from frontend to backend.
- **Continuous Integration**: Implementing CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.

## Security
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypting sensitive employee data both in transit and at rest.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Using JWT for secure authentication and implementing role-based access control.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Preventing SQL injection and other common attacks by validating and sanitizing inputs.
- **Security Headers**: Using Helmet to set secure HTTP headers.

## Observability
