# NodeJS-Project-Demo
## Description
This project is a simple Employee Management API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API provides a backend service for managing employee records in a MongoDB database. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data, including details like name, phone number, visa ID, and address.
